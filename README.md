## About

This is the source code for my personal website, [k348li.netlify.app](https://k348li.netlify.app/). I built this website to try out some React technologies and to have a place to showcase my future projects.

The site is built with:
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion


## TODO List

My next steps and ideas for the website:
- Complete intro card with description and contact info
- Add work experience card
- (Add other content cards)
- Dark mode
- Make background lively, like the cards are on a wooden desk, dark mode toggle is a lamp switch
