## About

This is the source code for my personal website, [k348li.netlify.app](https://k348li.netlify.app/). I built this website to try out some React technologies and to have a place to showcase my future projects.

The site is built with:
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- react-icons


## TODO List

My next steps and ideas for the website:
- Add work experience card
- Add card for project features
- Add card for hobby showcase
- Dark mode
- Add "table of contents" on side to scroll directly to relevant card
- Make background lively, like the cards are on a wooden desk, dark mode toggle is a lamp switch
